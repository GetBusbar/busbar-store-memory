//!
//! - a key is opaque bytes, not a string, so a key with a NUL or an invalid UTF-8 byte in it round

//! - schemas are separate namespaces — the same key under two schemas is two records;
//! - a put REPLACES, so a schema's row has one current value and never a history;
//! - a scan is a PREFIX walk in key order, bounded by its own limit, and `limit` 0 means nothing;
//! - an absent record reads back as `None` and never as an error.
